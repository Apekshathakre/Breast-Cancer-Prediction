# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Introduction

Breast cancer is a cancer that forms in the cells of the breast. Breast cancer can occur in women and rarely in men. It requires a medical diagnosis, through lab tests or imaging.

It is the most common cancer in women around the world. in 2020 alone, there were 2.3million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 685,000 deaths globally. As of the end of 2021, there were 7.8million women alive who were diagnosed with breast cancer in the past 5years, making it the world's most prevalent cancer. in addition, about 0.5-1% of cancer patients are male.

Symptoms of a breast cancer includes a lump in the breast, bloody discharge from the nipple, and changes in the shape or texture of the nipple or breast. Other symptoms include breast discomfort, inverted nipple, skin redness or swollen lymph nodes.

It is treatable by a medical professional(oncologist). Treatment depends on the stage of cancer. It may consist of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery.

Surgery type includes Lumpectomy, Mastectomy e.t.c Lumpectomy - is a surgical removal of a discrete portion or lump of breast tissue ,usually in the treatment of malignant tumour or breast cancer. Mastectomy - is surgical removal of one or both breasts, partially or completely.

We can use machine learning to predict whether a patient will survive breast cancer or not.
Data understanding

This dataset consists of a group of breast cancer patients, who had surgery to remove the tumour. The dataset consists of these variables:

Patient_ID: unique identifier id of a patient

Age: Age of patient (Years)

Gender: Male/Female.

Protein1, Protein2, Protein3, Protein4: These expression levels are biomarker for the dectection of breast cancer.

Tumour_Stage: I, II, III. It is a form of staging to describe the extensiveness of breast cancer, based on the size of the tumor and its spread to the lymph nodes.

Histology: Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma.

ER status: Positive/Negative:(Estrogen receptor) the hormone receptor determines the type of breast cancer to determine treatment.

PR status: Positive/Negative:(Progesterone receptor)the hormone receptor determines the type of breast cancer to determine treatment.

HER2 status: Positive/Negative.(human epidermal growth factor receptor2). This protein promotes the growth of cancer cells .

Surgery_type: Lumpectomy, Simple Mastectomy, Modified Radical Mastectomy, Other surgery type.

Date of Surgery: the date the surgery was performed (in DD-MON-YY).

Date of Last_Visit: Date of last visit (in DD-MON-YY) to the hospital. Patient_Status: If Alive or Dead
